  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p1>HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It is one way to create a simple website. All the sentences, paragraphs, pictures, and videos are organized by the way you use HTML.</p1>
  <br>
  <p2>I chose this class so that I could learn how a website is built. I don't know much about building websites and it seems that technology is advancing quickly so I figured it wouldn't hurt to have the knowledge. I plan on getting into business after highschool so having the knowledge of building an intriguing website could help my chances of getting more business. </p2>
